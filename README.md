# Crossmint Challenge

## Overview
This Spring Boot command-line application is designed to interact with the Megaverse API. The application allows users to create, delete, and manage astral objects on a map using a flexible and extensible command-line interface. This is also the paragraph where I thank the Crossmint team for such a fun code challenge! üòÅ

## Juicy Notes and Assumptions
* Application has been designed to be as much simple and self-contained as possible, therefore Spring has been used for convenient tools (e.g., DI management, WebClient and Reactor for easy and parallel API calls with retry mechanisms)
* Solution leverages the undocumented (üòâ) `/api/map/[candidateId]`, which retrieves the current status of the map. This is used for efficiently delete all elements in the current map in `deleteAll` and `replicateGoal` commands
* Yes, instead of (efficiently) wiping out the current map before replacting the goal one, a "diff" (current vs goal maps) could have been implemented. The solution was reflecting the efficiency/simplicity trade-off as best as possible.
* Parallel calls, backoff, jitter and request delays are implemented (see `AstralObjectService`), but they have *not* been fine-tuned. `replicateGoal` is slow, but faster than the sequential version üòÅ
* Solution assumes that `/api/map` endpoint(s) will always return the same amount of columns for each row (i.e., only the length of the first row is checked)
* Solution includes a **deprecated** version of the first phase command called `CreateXShapePolyanetCommand`. The author implemented it as a fast-forward solution, but the `replicateGoal` command covers the first phase solution as well. Deprecated class is left as reference
* Performing a `DELETE /api/polyanets` can actually delete *any* astral object (this is being used in both delete commands described below). It is not ideal for sure (and in a real case scenario a proper object/request should be created), but deleting logic was kept simple
* To keep things simple, concurrency is not addressed in provided solution
* `mvn verify` will fail if Jacoco line coverage < 80% (except excluded classes)

## Features
* Create various astral objects:
   * Polyanets
   * Soloons (with different colors)
   * Comeths (with different directions)
* Delete specific or all astral objects - by deleting only existing ones while using current map state.
* Fetches the goal map, and replicates it.
* Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
* Parallel processing of API requests

## Technology Stack
* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.2.3
* PicoCLI for command-line interface
* WebClient for reactive HTTP requests
* JUnit 5 for testing
* Mockito for mocking
* Jacoco for code coverage

## Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 21
* Maven 3.6 or higher

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crossmint-challenge.git
   cd crossmint-challenge
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash 
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Running the Application
Using Maven, you can run the application and pass command-line arguments in one step:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="<command> <arguments>"
```

## Available Commands
1. Create Astral Objects:
   ```bash
   # Create a Polyanet
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="create polyanet <x> <y>"
   
   # Create a Soloon with a specific color  
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="create soloon <x> <y> <color>"

   # Create a Cometh with a specific direction
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="create cometh <x> <y> <direction>"
   ```

2. Delete Objects:
   ```bash
   # Delete a specific astral object
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="delete <x> <y>"

   # Delete all astral objects
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="deleteall"
   ```

3. Replicate Goal Map:

   **IMPORTANT:** executing the `replicategoal` will first clear the whole map.

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="replicategoal"
   ```

## Configuration
Key configuration parameters are defined in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
* `crossmint.candidate-id`: Your unique candidate identifier
* `crossmint.api.base-url`: Base URL for the Crossmint API
* `crossmint.parallel-degree`: Number of parallel API requests
* Retry and request delay configurations

## Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
mvn test
```

Run tests with code coverage report:
```bash
mvn verify
```

The coverage report will be generated in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`

## Error Handling
The application includes robust error handling:
* Retry mechanism for rate limiting and server errors (5 by default)
* Detailed logging
* Coordinate validation
* Graceful error reporting
